# in-page-mustache

Was wondering how much code I needed to implement [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) for use inside a page as an exercise. Left the "Set Delimiter" section as unsupported by this since changing inside a page the way this would proably be used. Different separators can be sent in as options though.

[Test page](test.html)
[Regular](in-page-mustache.js)
[Minified](in-page-mustache.min.js)
